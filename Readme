- Well, you are here. You might be wondering exactly why the code looks very unprofessional and untidy, or why there are a lot of spelling errors or bad logic in general.
Unfortunatly, this is not a repository owned by someone who actually knows what they are doing. This is my first public repository and I aim to use it to learn shader programming while I show off my progress... Atleast that was the plan. I have the project configured in a way that makes it simple to have many shader implementations ready to go in a button click.
I know this is bad, but we'll cross that bridge when we get to it. Anyone who is willing to enbark on this journey with me can clone the repo, do their thing and can create a pull request if they also want to show off their progress/implementation.
An implementation has to be a module at the moment, I do hope it's not too clutered to understand.
That's it for my boring introduction. You shall assumeÂ theÂ position.
